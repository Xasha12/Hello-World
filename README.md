# Hello-World
My first repository.

Yep... Here to learn how to code.
Former Marine and YCO who thought it would be fun to change the world via a hero archetype...
Done with that, and now ready for a change.
Looking to change my way of thinking, philosophy on being a moral compass, and accepting mistakes as progress. 

Challenge for change accepted.
